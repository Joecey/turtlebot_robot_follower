# Turtlebot Follower
Code that allows turtlebot to follow person using person object detection

### Notes
* Ensure that you are running in Python3
* Separate repo will be coming with launch files. However, if you plan to make your own launch files, ensure that you use absolute file path, rather than relative file path, when calling on deep learning files.
* robot_follow for program with launch files (Joe local machine)
* depth-detection-follow for prototyping (running with Python3)
* run "source devel/setup.bash" everytime new terminal opens
* Mediapipe implementation for analog control (dunno what this would be used for, but it's kinda cool)
* If you want to run with ros, use "catkin_make" to create a package
